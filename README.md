MotorcycleDynamics
==============

This library is used to model motorcycle chassis<. This library models complex phenomena that characterize
 the vehicles dynamics with two wheels. The modeling process of physical reality has made to emerge three principal entity:  
- Body: it understands the pilot end the chassis of motorcycle (suspension, wheel, steering gear,...);
- Road: it is the modelling of road where the motorcycle stir;
- Wheel-road interaction: it interface the two preceding components, it simulate present forces of contact

Hierarchical levels

The library is based on a
hierarchical structure within the total model. This is done to
give a clear overview of the model and simplify reusage of
components.
